# Homepage Website

This is my repository for a frontend application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is fully responsive and can be navigated to other pages.

This app is deployed to: https://enigmatic-bastion-35483.herokuapp.com

## The Landing Page

This is the top page, which the viewers will land on. It contains the necessary links and navigation for people to get around the site.

## The Navbar / Header

This is the navigation bar that doesn't scroll out of sight or disappear when the window is resized. CSS media queries are used to make sure that the site behaves in a reasonable way when viewed on a desktop in a browser, and on a mobile device. The hover effect is added to create mouseover interaction.
